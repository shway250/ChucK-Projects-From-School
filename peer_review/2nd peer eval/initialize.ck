// So, coding a jazz band would be quite difficult (I know that jazz was not a strict requirement,
//bu I liked the idea...). So, instead of coding a jazz band, I decided to code 
//a bad jazz band (that would attempt to play So What, failing miserably)! Jimmy is the serious guy of the three, he plays 
//the double bass, Mike is the guitarist, and as most guitarists, he doesn't pay much attention to the music, he mostly 
//pays attention to the pretty ladies in the public... Sean is the drummer. He has a serious drinking
//problem. 
//Enjoy, and most importantly, keep an eye on the console monitor to read what the
//guys have to say!! =)

// add score.ck
me.dir() + "/score.ck" => string scorePath;
Machine.add(scorePath);
